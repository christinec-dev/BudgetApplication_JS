# Budget Application 

A couple of years ago I created a GitHub Profile that went by the name of WebacyByChristine. Since then, I've learnt a lot more when it comes to programming, but I still wanted to share my older projects that I did to learn the basics of Javascript (I also lost my email address since then, oops!). This is a basic Budgeting App made with Javascript, which is pretty cool still.
